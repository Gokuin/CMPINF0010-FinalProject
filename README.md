## Overview of the Project
- This project uses python and datasets avaiable from the WPRDC(http://www.wprdc.org/) to analyze and decide upon the best neighborhood to live in in Pittsburgh. Each indivdual team notebook used a seperate metric to decide upon a neighborhood. After that we came together as a group to decide upon one best neighborhood by comparing our notebooks. This best neighborhood selected by the group is visable in the final project group notebook.
